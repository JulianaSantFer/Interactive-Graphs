TOOLS FOR VISUALIZATION : PYTHON(JUPYTER NOTEBOOK), PLOTLY PACKAGE.

INTRODUCTION
The dataset is about the FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). The goal of this dataset is to create an interactive and incremental data analysis starting from a model and readapting the features and having exploratory analysis.

The analysis provides pre-game, predictive data and individual player projections. STATS provides new opportunities and discoveries for analysts, fans and fantasy sports enthusiasts providing the information for play-by-plays, graphic visualizations and other analysis for coaches, analysts and commentators.

The visualization also impacts how the players can improve their game performance, the revenue which the club has to pay, the goals they scored and many other factors
The dataset contains 89 attributes about various information in which some of the few are: Name, Age, Nationality, Overall, Potential Club, Value, Wage, International, Reputation, Skill Moves, Height, Weight and Jersey Number


Environment: set setup (installation of packages / libraries)

Data Preprocessing (Data cleaning, Shaping)
Framing the Business questions
wrinting, analyzing the code and executing it
Forming different insights for the dataset
Deploying the results

Each team member has contributed equally in each and every stage of the project from choosing the dataset to deploying it in the web. It would be unfair to judge any single team member of there performance and contribution.

BUSINESS QUESTIONS 

1.)	What is the overall performance of the players?
2.)	What are the wages of the strikers?
3.)	What is the football ability, weak foot and reputation of the player in FIFA?
4.)	Comparison of players between dribbling and crossing.
5.)	Which country produces the most players?


•	The whole process of framing business questions, analyzing, deploying took around 1 week for us. The code execution and debugging consumed more time as it was more challenging to create and deploy interactive graphs.

•	We chose the particular dataset because football is a sport played by the whole world and to know the players performance, countiries involoved, revenue generated, overall performance of the players and much more.

•	We chose Python for the code execution and for interface we chose Jupyter Notebook as it is a powerful and simple web based library. 

•	After the successful execution we got the following results as shown in https://jusfernandesp.wixsite.com/interactivegraphs which is also explained in the report.
